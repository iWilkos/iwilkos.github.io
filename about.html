                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm currently pursuing my HNC in Computing at Boston College, 
                    with a strong passion for cybersecurity and a curiosity for emerging technologies.</p> 
                
                <p>My journey into tech started with Minecraft servers, where I tweaked the configu files, and experimented briefly
                    with Java, where I created a plugin that created a command that said something to the player.
                    That taste of coding sparked interest in other technologies like building PCs and learning about how they work.
                    Which eventually led to my interest in cybersecurity due to drama shows like Arrow and The Flash.
                </p>

                <p>Beyond technology, I have gained valuable teamwork and customer service experience from roles at Pizza Hut,
                    M&S and Tesco, at Pizza hut is where I strongly developed team coordination skills in a fast-paced kitchen environment.
                    ensuring smooth operations and a positive customer experience and maintaining a clean and safe working environment.
                </p>

                <p>I am always eager to learn, problem-solve, and grow my skills in the field of computing and especially cybersecurity,
                    Feel free to check out my CV and projects to see my skills and experience.
                </p>
